# Portfolio

Hello! This repository is a showcase of my SQL skills that I have acquired showcases examples of SQL I have written for solo projects and while working through SQL Courses, Bootcamps, Certifications and other data analytics courses. Additionally, Tableau projects I have created while learning data visualization have been highlighted below along with my SQL projects. 

## Highlighted Projects

* **Birth Dates Data Clean-up** -  [SQL](https://github.com/SabastianMoselle/SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/Birth_Dates): In this project, I imported and cleaned up a kaggle dataset of births from 1994 to 1997. Using DATE_FORMAT, STR_TO_DATE, and CONCAT to combine 3 columns together making the result set easier to read, then transfering the new data to a new table with the correct columns. Going from 3 DATE columns to one DATE column in the proper format('%Y-%m-%d').
