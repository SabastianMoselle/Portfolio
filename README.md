# SQL-Portfolio

Hello! This repository is a showcase of my SQL skills that I have acquired showcases examples of SQL I have written for solo projects and while working through SQL Courses, Bootcamps and Certifications. 

I have a clear understanding of SELECT queries with filtering, INNER and LEFT JOINS, aggregation, use of DATE functions, CASE statement, UNIONs,
using derived tables and subqueries, string handling functions.
Additionally, an understanding of using different query variations to get the same result!

Am currently learning PARTITION BY, Window Functions and Window Frames.
