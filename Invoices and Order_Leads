--This SQL File shows a clean up of both result sets if needed and query examples.
--Data Source: 2 result sets from Kaggle.com
--Table Names: invoices and order_leads

--Create Table before importing:
CREATE TABLE invoices (
	Order_ID VARCHAR(200),
	Date VARCHAR(60),
    Meal_ID VARCHAR(200),
    Company_ID VARCHAR(200),
    Date_Of_Meal DATE,
    Meal_Price INT,
    Type_Of_Meal TEXT
)
--Made the Date column a VARCHAR because it wasn't in the correct format for the DATE datatype. However, Date_Of_Meal was in the correct format.
CREATE TABLE order_leads(
	Order_ID VARCHAR(200),
    Date VARCHAR(60),
    Company_ID VARCHAR(200),
    Company_Name TEXT,
    Order_Value INT,
    Converted TINYINT
)
--Made the Date column a VARCHAR because it wasn't in the correct format for the DATE datatype. 


--Added a PRIMARY KEY constraint to Order_ID and Meal_ID on the invoices table
ALTER TABLE invoices
ADD CONSTRAINT PK_invoices PRIMARY KEY (Order_ID, Meal_ID)

--Then, added a FOREIGN KEY constraint to Order_ID on the order_leads table
ALTER TABLE order_leads
ADD FOREIGN KEY(Order_ID) REFERENCES invoices(Order_ID)


--Additional clean up needed within the Date VARCHAR(60) column. Need to convert the string to a date, then change the new date value's format.
UPDATE invoices 
SET Date = DATE_FORMAT(STR_TO_DATE(Date, '%d-%m-%Y'), '%Y-%m-%d')

--Then, change the Date column to the correct datatype.
ALTER TABLE invoices
MODIFY COLUMN Date DATE

--Samething within the order_leads table.
UPDATE order_leads 
SET Date = DATE_FORMAT(STR_TO_DATE(Date, '%d-%m-%Y'), '%Y-%m-%d')

--Then, change the Date column to the correct datatype.
ALTER TABLE order_leads
MODIFY COLUMN Date DATE
